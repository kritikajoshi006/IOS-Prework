## App I want to build
I want to build an app that would help students stay on track in their college life. It combines task management, academic tracking, and social tools to create an organized and stress-free experience. Some key features:
   - Assignment and deadline tracker
   - Notes organizer
   - Grade tracker
   - Schedule
